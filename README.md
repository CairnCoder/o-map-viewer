## O-map viewer

This is a project I envisioned in 2018.
It is code for a website that can be used to study (Orienteering) maps in bitmap format.


However, it is only now, in 2025, with the advent of accelerated programming using ChatGPT, that it has been realised to my satisfaction. Prior to AI tools, I had developed a version that was acceptable but only suited for Windows devices being a Universal Windows Program, and probably totalled 400 hours of work. Now, with the aid of ChatGPT and newer versions of OpenLayers, this latest version was completed in just 20 hours.

If you are an Orienteer, you will understand the puropse quite quickly.
The key features I wanted to combine were the colour-picking tools from GIMP, the ability to use touchscreen interactions (zoom, pan, and rotate), some basic leg-viewing capabilities, and distance measurements. 

This is a working version and can be found at <a>https://omapviewer.pythonanywhere.com/</a>.
